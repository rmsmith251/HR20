    <div id="Climate Change Overview">
        <h1>What is climate change?</h1>
        <h2>Climate Change Defined</h2>
        <p>Climate change is a complex topic but is <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/k-4/stories/nasa-knows/what-is-climate-change-k4.html" target="_blank"> generally defined</a> as the change in usual weather in a place. Typically, when climate change is mentioned with regards to global warming, the climate change that is being mentioned is global climate change. The real key is that climate change metrics depend on the scope. In other words, climate change is both for local weather and global conditions. Generally speaking, the climate change referred to on this website will be with respect to the change in the global climate, unless local climate is specifically mentioned.</p>
        <h2>What does this have to do with people?</h2>
        <p><a href="smog_la.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="round-image-corners" align="right" src="smog_la_thumb.jpg" alt="Smog over Los Angeles in 2006"></a>Climate change is a serious issue that has already been making lives worse for millions of people. For instance, Los Angeles has been <a href="https://www.nhpr.org/post/progress-smog-los-angeles#stream/0" target="_blank">actively working on improving</a> their air quality over the past several decades. The leaders there have enacted some of the strictest regulations but for good reason. There are multiple ways to get rid of air pollution but the one that works without serious long term health complications is by enacting policy changes to reduce carbon emissions in vehicles.</p>
        <p>China's rapid rise in industrialization is an example of how bad smog can get. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollution_in_China" targe="_blank">pollution in China</a> is a topic of great discussion but cities such as Beijing are severely impacted by choking smog. Beijing in particular is surrounded by mountains which ends up preventing particulates from dispersing creating the thick layer of smog. As reported in <a href="https://cen.acs.org/articles/95/i4/Peering-Chinas-thick-haze-air.html">Chemical and Engineering News</a> increasing concentrations of PM2.5 (particulates up to 2.5 microns in diameter or roughly 24 times smaller than the width of a human hair) by 5 micrograms (roughly a billionth of a pound) per meter cubed increases the rate of coronary artery calcium deposits, leading to a higher risk of coronary diseases (<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(16)31597-5/fulltext">source</a>) where another study found that for every 5 micrograms/cubic meter higher concentration of PM2.5, the risk of hypertension increased by 22% for the people living in those areas (<a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article/38/13/983/2439478">source</a>). The Chinese government has been working on improving air quality and emissions with policies such as the "National Sword Policy" as well as using some more strict measures such as a driving lottery. One thing that the citizens have been doing is purchasing electric vehicles to attempt to curb their emissions due to burning gasoline and diesel (we'll go over sources of electricity in another section). In fact, more electric vehicles are sold in China than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_energy_vehicles_in_China">anywhere else in the world</a> which was in part due to government incentives. With these and other measures enacted, Beijing's air pollution has been improving and with continued effort, they can have clean air again.</p>
        <p>In the following sections we'll break down some of the serious issues related to climate change and why they're happening.</p>
