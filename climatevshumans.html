        <h1>Climate Change, The Environment, and Humans</h1>

        <h2>What about the environment?</h2>

        <p>On the previous page, we talked a little bit about the health effects of living in a smog filled environment but that's only one way that people can be affected by the climate and greenhouse gases (we'll talk more about greenhouse gases on the next page). It's not just the air that gets polluted by the industrialization. Water tables can be polluted by chemical spills or leaks. Many chemical plants in the US are also quite old. Many plants were built in the mid 20th century and while they are constantly maintained by the engineers and technicians, these plants are still long past their designed lifespan. The standard lifespan when designing a new (greenfield/grassroots) chemical plant is 25 years. Almost all of the parts must be serviced or replaced in time spans much shorter than that (5 years, 10 years, etc). While these plants are able to stay in operation much longer than 25 years, there will inevitably be breakdowns and issues as the plants get older.</p>
        <p>So what am I even getting on about? Well, these chemical plants are typically not placed in the middle of nowhere. That wouldn't make sense. These plants are generally placed in low-income or minority locations meaning that low-income or minority populations are at much higher risk of being impacted by failures. I (Ryan Smith) lived in Port Arthur, Texas (chapter 3; Lerner, Steve. Sacrifice Zones. <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/sacrifice-zones"target="_blank">Link</a>), for work on a new ethylene plant from 2019 to 2020. While I was sleeping on November 27, 2019, the TPC chemical plant in Port Neches, Texas (about 4 miles from my apartment) <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/27/us/texas-explosion-port-neches-tpc.html"target="_blank">exploded for the first time that day</a>. Fortunately, I was far enough away not to notice any effects but many coworkers of mine were woken up and had damage to their houses. Unbeknownst to me, I was not able to receive phone calls or SMS messages at the time so you can imagine how concerned my family was when I wasn't returning their calls and texts. Fortunately, in the TPC incident no one was killed (3 employees were injured) but this could have been much worse. Port Arthur, Texas is a largely minority town and it isn't the only one. Sacrifice Zones by Steve Lerner (link above) looks at many of these communities and how they're at a significantly higher risk of complications.

        <p><a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/unequal-impact-the-deep-links-between-inequality-and-climate-change"target="_blank">This article</a> by Beth Gardiner on Yale Environment 360 is worth a read on how minorities are disproportionately impacted by climate change and other environmental health hazards. </p>
        <h2>Other Notable Incidents</h2>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhopal_disaster"target="_blank">Bhopal Disaster</a> - possibly the worst industrial disaster in history. On the night of December 2-3, 1984, the Union Carbide India Limited pesticide plant in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, India leaked methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas. Over 500,000 people were exposed to the gas with at least 3,787 people killed (over 16,000 claimed) and at least 558,125 non-fatal injuries. MIC is approximately twice as dense as air which caused it to accumulate on the ground meaning that children inhaled significantly higher concentrations than adults.</p>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Fertilizer_Company_explosion"target="_blank">West Fertilizer Company explosion</a> - on April 17, 2013, an ammonium nitrate explosion ocurred at the West Fertilizer Company facility in West, Texas. Fifteen people were killed, more than 160 were injured, and more than 150 buildings were damaged or destroyed.</p>
