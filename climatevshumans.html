        <h1>Climate and Humans</h1>

        <h2>What is concerning?</h2>

        <p>On the previous page, we talked a little bit about the health effects of living in a smog filled environment but that's only one way that people can be affected by the climate and greenhouse gases (we'll talk more about greenhouse gases on the next page). It's not just the air that gets polluted by the industrialization. Water tables can be polluted by chemical spills or leaks. Many chemical plants in the US are also quite old. Many plants were built in the mid 20th century and while they are constantly maintained by the engineers and technicians, these plants are still long past their designed lifespan. The standard lifespan when designing a new (greenfield/grassroots) chemical plant is 25 years. Almost all of the parts must be serviced or replaced in time spans much shorter than that (5 years, 10 years, etc). While these plants are able to stay in operation much longer than 25 years, there will inevitably be breakdowns and issues as the plants get older.</p>
        <p>So what am I even getting on about? Well, these chemical plants are typically not placed in the middle of nowhere. That wouldn't make sense. These plants are generally placed in low-income or minority locations meaning that low-income or minority populations are at much higher risk of being impacted by failures. I (Ryan Smith) lived in Port Arthur, Texas (chapter 3; Lerner, Steve. Sacrifice Zones. <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/sacrifice-zones">Link</a>), for work on a new ethylene plant from 2019 to 2020. While I was sleeping on November 27, 2019, the TPC chemical plant in Port Neches, Texas (about 4 miles from my apartment) <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/27/us/texas-explosion-port-neches-tpc.html">exploded for the first time that day</a>. Fortunately, I was far enough away not to notice any effects but many coworkers of mine were woken up and had damage to their houses. Unbeknownst to me, I was not able to receive phone calls or SMS messages at the time so you can imagine how concerned my family was when I wasn't returning their calls and texts. Fortunately, in the TPC incident no one was killed (3 employees were injured) but this could have been much worse. Port Arthur, Texas is a largely minority town and it isn't the only one. Sacrifice Zones by Steve Lerner (link above) looks at many of these communities and how they're at a significantly higher risk of complications.
