        <h1>What's being done to try and fix the issues?</h1>
        <h2>Batteries and Electric Cars</h2>
        <p>Possibly one of the most promising technologies of active research is something that everyone knows about: batteries. We all know the pain of a phone battery that dies while in an important call or video chat but what is being done to make that better and how does that relate to the environment and climate change? We'll expand on why batteries are so fascinating and how electric cars are paving the way (pun intended) to a better climate.</p>
        <h2>Renewable Energy</h2>
        <p>In this section, we'll go over what renewables are, why they are necessary, and what is being done to further their growth.</p>
        <h2>Nuclear Energy</h2>
        <p>We all know about Chernobyl, Fukushima, and many people know about Three Mile Island but did you know that the production of nuclear energy is <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/safest-sources-of-energy" target="_blank">far safer than fossil fuel production?</a> In this section, we'll go over common misunderstandings with nuclear energy, how nuclear energy is produced, and what it could mean for the environment.</p>
        <h2>The Future</h2>
        <p>In the last section, we'll take our time machine to the future and make completely accurate and totally not unpredictable predictions. All kidding aside, we'll look at the future of technology as a whole and how things can play out with different scenarios.</p>
