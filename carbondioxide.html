        <h1>Carbon Dioxide</h1>

        <h2>What is carbon dioxide (CO2)?</h2>
        <img class="round-image-corners" align="right" src="co2.png" alt="Carbon dioxide molecule">
        <p>Carbon dioxide is a molecule composed of one carbon atom (grey in the photo to the right) and two oxygen atoms (red in the photo to the right). You probably know it as the thing that makes your soda fizzy. It's a colorless gas that's usually odorless but at high concentrations has a sharp and acidic odor.</p>
        <p>Carbon dioxide is what's known as a greenhouse gas. Greenhouse gases got their name because of the "greenhouse" effect that they have. In other words, these gases allow heat through the atmosphere but when the heat is radiated off of the Earth's surface, they trap some of that heat. This is not all bad though! Without this effect, the Earth would be an icy ball and not conducive to life! The problem is that too much of a good thing is also bad (I'm looking at you, ice cream). If the concentration of these gases gets too high, the amount of radiation (heat) that is trapped also goes up, making the Earth warmer.</p>
        <h2>What are the other greenhouse gases?</h2>
        <p>The primary greenhouse gases in Earth's atmosphere are: water vapor, carbon dioxide, methan, nitrous oxide, and ozone (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_gas" target="_blank">Greenhouse gas Wikipedia page</a>). These gases all contribute but the main drivers are carbon dioxide and methane. The reason that CO2 is the primary concern has to do with how long the gases stay in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide's atmospheric lifetime is between 30 and 95 years while methane's atmospheric lifetime is 12. That means that if you release 1 cubic meter of methane and 1 cubic meter of carbon dioxide, the methane will no longer be in the atmosphere after 12 years but the carbon dioxide will remain for at least another 18 years and possibly for 83 more.</p>
        <h2>What about the data?</h2>
        <img src="Vostok_Petit_data.svg" alt="Ice Core Data" style="background-color: white; box-shadow:8px 8px 10px black;" class="center" >
        <p>The chart above (from the greenhouse gas wikipedia page) shows ice core data from the Vostok research station in Antarctica up until the year 1999 (CO2 levels are now over 400ppmv or parts per million by volume). Ice cores are very useful for telling the history of the Earth. Every year, the new layers of ice are created which over hundreds of thousands of years has created many many layers of ice in Antarctica. These layers are analyzed by researchers to determine what the atmosphere consisted of. Back to the chart. Notice how the the green and blue lines (carbon dioxide levels and temperature variation) move up and down together. This shows that a rise in carbon dioxide also raises the global average temperature. The thing to note here, other than the CO2 levels being 100ppmv below current levels, is that those periodic elevations in carbon dioxide were also followed by massive drops in the average global temperature. This is largely due to the Milankovitch cycles (<a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/explainer-how-the-rise-and-fall-of-co2-levels-influenced-the-ice-ages"target="_blank">more on that here</a>). These cycles, increase and decrease how much carbon dioxide is released from sources that naturally contain them. Periods where the Earth is closer to the Sun increase the amount of glacial ice that is melted which then increases sea levels, reducing the amount of land is available for vegetation. The increase in temperature also increases the melting of permafrost which is another natural collector of carbon dioxide. Do you remember the soda I mentioned at the beginning of this page? Well carbon dioxide dissolves more readily in cold water so the warmer waters won't absorb as much atmospheric carbon dioxide. All of these factors, along with many more, lead to an atmosphere that is increasingly warmer.</p>
        <p>In the past, the Milankovitch cycles would then lead to a period where the Earth is farther from the Sun and the Earth would cool down with the reverse of the previously mentioned effects.</p>
        <h2>Well what about this time? Won't we just go into an ice age?</h2>
        <p>The short answer: no. The problem here is that, as mentioned before, the current (as of September 2020) CO2 level is between 411 ppm and 412 ppm (<a href="https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/monthly.html"target="_blank">NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory</a>). That means that as of today, we are over 100 ppm above the highest level recorded in the past 400,000 years. To put it another way, the current level is over 130% of the highest level recorded. This sudden increase is raising the average global temperature at an alarming rate and if the global temperature gets too high, there is a possibility that we will not be able to recover. Controlling the climate is difficult but there are things that we can do to help prevent the worst from happening.</p>
